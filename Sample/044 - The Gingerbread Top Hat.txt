[Verse 1]
E                A
Cellophane sidewalks are melting in the sun
G#m7                     C#m7
A marching band of garden gnomes is strictly having fun
F#m7                       B7
Their leader wears a top hat made of gingerbread and glue
E                   B7                 E
He's asking me for pennies, but only if they're blue

[Verse 2]
E                         A
The mayor is a mannequin who speaks in perfect rhyme
G#m7                   C#m7
He's polishing the city clock to try and stop the time
F#m7                    B7
His deputies are teapots, they whistle when they're mad
E                 B7                    E      E7
It's the most peculiar government we've ever had

[Chorus]
A               E
Oh, the lemon-colored sky is falling down
G#7             C#m
In fragments of a forgotten town
F#7
Don't you see it, can't you see it now?
B7sus4            B7
Floating on the sea-saw, wow!

[Verse 3]
E                     A
I'm writing a letter on a cabbage leaf
G#m7                C#m7
To a man I met last Thursday, a very friendly thief
F#7                     B7
He stole my shadow and sold it for a song
E                     B7                 E      E7
Now I'm stuck here humming it the whole day long

[Chorus]
A               E
Oh, the lemon-colored sky is falling down
G#7             C#m
In fragments of a forgotten town
F#7
Don't you see it, can't you see it now?
B7sus4            B7
Floating on the sea-saw, wow!

A               E
Oh, the lemon-colored sky is falling down
G#7             C#m
In fragments of a forgotten town
F#7
Don't you see it, can't you see it now?
B7sus4            B7
Floating on the sea-saw, wow!
